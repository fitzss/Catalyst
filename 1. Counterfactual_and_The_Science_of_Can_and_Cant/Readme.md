# About the power of taking counterfactual explanations of the world seriously.

## Counterfactual explanations of the world are explanations about what physical events could or could not be made to happen.

### The Science of Can and Can’t sets out in nontechnical terms a new, counterfactual mode of explanation based on scientific and philosophical ideas that the author, Chiara Marletto, and I have pioneered. They provide new tools and new principles to address a number of notorious problems in physics and beyond. With a light but sure touch, Chiara Marletto argues for an emerging new theory, including a corpus of new and updated laws of nature—principles that will inform not just the next generation of atomscale heat engines and nanorobots, but also artificial intelligence

# In the past few decades, in contrast, there have been none — no new mode of explanationabout physical phenomena has been discovered.
## Not only can counterfactuals provide new explanations; they are the foundation of a new mode of explanation.
### Though the overall rate of scientific discovery has greatly increased by almost any measure, the discovery of fundamentally new truths about nature has, paradoxically, become less frequent. In fundamental physics in particular, there has been less and less exploration of transformative ideas—and new modes of explanation are not even being attempted.
