# Catalyst: Redefining Robotic Software with Precision

## Why Catalyst?

Catalyst is a task-oriented robotic software language designed to harness the possibilities and constraints—what *can* and *cannot* be achieved—within robotic systems. It leverages Constructor Theory, where tasks are fundamental transformations governed by the laws of physics.

### Counterfactual API

Catalyst introduces the **Counterfactual API**, which captures what tasks are possible (*CAN*) and what are impossible (*CAN'T*). This framework ensures that every task aligns with the physical constraints and possibilities of the environment, allowing developers to build reliable and efficient robotic systems.

### Vision

By focusing on counterfactual explanations—understanding what physical events could or could not happen—Catalyst provides a solid foundation for creating robotic systems that operate within their true physical limits. It's a precise and practical tool for the next generation of robotic software development.
