* # Physics aims at solving problems; as a consequence, it seeks, if possible, universal and exact testable laws,formulated in whatever mode of explanation happens to be appropriate.


## From the question of performing any computation. but now performing any transformation of physical objects, and not if given enough memory but, if given only knowledge because if there’s something you have to give it other then knowledge which itself couldn’t provide then its not universal.

### The traditional conception of physics and science, takes for granted that scientific theories can only be about what must happen in the universe (or is likely to), given what has happened. But none of that is true. It is no more than an arbitrary limitation on our ability to understand the world.  Incorporating counterfactuals on an equal footing with factual statements into fundamental physics.

# The traditional conception of physics cannot express counterfactual properties

# Fundamental Counterfactuals and Their Relation to the Physical World

This document provides an overview of fundamental counterfactuals and their connection to the physical world. The table below outlines key phenomena, the corresponding counterfactuals, physical laws, and notable related entities.

## Table of Counterfactuals and Physical World Relations

This table is central to understanding how counterfactuals (alternative possibilities) manifest in physical systems and how these systems are bound by fundamental physical laws.

## The constructor theory that I shall propose in this paper is not primarily

  - The theory of constructions or constructors, as the prevailing conception would
    require it to be. 
    Constructor-theoretic statements never refer to specific
    constructors, only to the fact that tasks are possible or impossible. - InfoTheo


  - It is the theory of which transformations
    input state of substrates → output state of substrates (2)
    can be caused and which cannot, and why. 

  - As I shall explain, the idea is that the
    fundamental questions of physics can all be expressed in terms of those issues, and
    that the answers do not depend on what the constructor is, so it can be abstracted
    away, leaving transformations (2) as the basic subject matter of the theory.

  - I shall argue that we should expect such a theory to constitute a fundamental branch of
    physics with new, universal laws, and to provide a powerful new language for
    expressing other theories. I shall guess what some of those laws may be, and explore
    the theory’s potential for solving various problems and achieving various
    unifications between disparate branches of physics and beyond, and propose a
    notation that may be useful in developing it.


## Explanatory theories with such counter-factual implications are more fundamental than predictions of what will happen.

  - A task A is possible (which I write as A✓ ) if the laws of nature impose no
    limit, short of perfection, on how accurately A could be performed, nor on how well
    things that are capable of approximately performing it could retain their ability to do
    so. Otherwise A is impossible (which I write as A✗ ).

  - It may be that construction tasks are the primitive entities in terms of which the laws
    of nature are expressed. In that case, a ‘set of ordered pairs of states’ would be only a
    provisional way of conceiving of tasks: ultimately substrates, states and
    transformations would be understood in terms of tasks, not vice versa.

  - A construction task specifies only intrinsic attributes of its substrates, not extrinsic
    ones such as the name or location of a particular instance.

# All the counterfactual properties you have encountered are expressible as statements about which transformations are possible and which are not, and why. 

# Counterfactual properties of physical systems
  ## The fundamental types of counterfactuals that occur in Physics are of two kinds:
        - one is the Impossibility of performing a transformation
        - the other is the Possibility of performing a transformation

# Assertions about probabilities do not refer to the physical world they don’t assert anything about the physical world.

# A daring speculation is therefore that all the laws of physics could be formulated solely in terms of principles about counterfactuals, and that the laws of motion follow from them as derivative, and perhaps approximate, properties.

  - ## Exploring this possibility is the start of an exciting research programme. 

# Constructor Theory fundamental objects are tasks

  - Tasks
    which is a specification
    of a physical transformation on a
    Substrate,
    with some input attributes,
    with some output attributes.

  - Attributes
    are properties of a substrate
    that can be in different states.

  - State
    a specific condition that an
    attribute can have.

  - Constructor
    something that performs the task reliably
    an object that can perform the task
    and stays the same after doing it.

# In Constructor Theory all laws of physics are stated by saying what tasks are possible, what are impossible, and why.
  - They are principles, which underlie and supplement the existing most fundamental theories of physics, from these principles, the traditional description in terms of initial conditions and laws of motion can be recovered in many cases.
  - Much more can be said without approximations.

# Constructor Theory forms principles about counterfactuals that are stated by saying what tasks are possible, what are impossible, and why.

# Factual explanations are explanations about what must happen in the universe (or what is likely to), given what has happened.
  - Factuals are facts about what is the ‘actual’

# Counterfactual explanations of the world are explanations about what physical events could or could not be made to happen.

# Counterfactuals are the foundation of a new mode of explanation which can provide new explanations.

# Counterfactuals are facts about what could or could not be.


# Counterfactual Explanations are statements
  - about what could or could not be there,
  - what it could or could not do,
  - and how it could or could not do that,
  - and why it could or could not do that too.
