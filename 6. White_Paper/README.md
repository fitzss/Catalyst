# Physical systems are objects that exist in the real world, which we attempt to describe via theory. In the mathematical sciences, we invoke mathematical objects (e.g. scalars, vectors, tensors) to represent the state of a physical system. - Kuyper

# Counterfactual properties of physical systems
  ## The fundamental types of counterfactuals that occur in Physics are of two kinds:
        - one is the Impossibility of performing a transformation
        - the other is the Possibility of performing a transformation
