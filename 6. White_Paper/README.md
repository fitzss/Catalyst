# Physical systems are objects that exist in the real world, which we attempt to describe via theory. In the mathematical sciences, we invoke mathematical objects (e.g. scalars, vectors, tensors) to represent the state of a physical system. - Kuyper

# Counterfactual properties of physical systems
  ## The fundamental types of counterfactuals that occur in Physics are of two kinds:
        - one is the Impossibility of performing a transformation
        - the other is the Possibility of performing a transformation
## Explanatory theories with such counter-factual implications are more fundamental than predictions of what will happen.

#  All the laws of physics could be formulated solely in terms of principles about counterfactuals, and that the laws of motion follow from them as derivative, and perhaps approximate, properties.
