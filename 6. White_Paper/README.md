# Physical systems are objects that exist in the real world, which we attempt to describe via theory. In the mathematical sciences, we invoke mathematical objects (e.g. scalars, vectors, tensors) to represent the state of a physical system. - Kuyper

# Counterfactual properties of physical systems
  ## The fundamental types of counterfactuals that occur in Physics are of two kinds:
        - one is the Impossibility of performing a transformation
        - the other is the Possibility of performing a transformation
## Explanatory theories with such counter-factual implications are more fundamental than predictions of what will happen.

#  All the laws of physics could be formulated solely in terms of principles about counterfactuals, and that the laws of motion follow from them as derivative, and perhaps approximate, properties.

# Constructor Theory forms Principles about counterfactuals that are stated by saying what tasks are possible, what are impossible, and why.

In constructor theory all laws of physics are stated by saying what tasks are possible, what are impossible, and why. They are principles, which underlie and supplement the existing most fundamental theories of physics.

A **task** is a
**specified physical transformation** on a **substrate**,
which involves changing an **attribute** from one **state** to another.

A **constructor** for a **task T**
is a **system** which whenever presented 
with the substrate of the **substrate** of the **task T**
in one of the **input attributes**,
it delivers it in one of the **states** 
of the allowed **output attributes**,
and **retains the ability to do that again**.

A **task**
is **impossible**
if the laws of physics impose a limit on how accurately 
it can be performed by a **constructor**.
Otherwise,
  the **task** is possible.

**Constructor-theoretic** statements
never refer to specific **constructors**,
only to the fact that 
**tasks** are **possible** or **impossible**.

This is what allows them to be **scale** **and** **dynamics** **independent**.
