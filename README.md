# Pillur: Applying Constructor Theory to Robotic Software Development

## Overview

**Pillur** is an innovative project focused on revolutionizing robotic software development by applying the principles of constructor theory. Rooted in the groundbreaking ideas of David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto, Pillur aims to redefine how robotic software is conceptualized, developed, and tested. By leveraging constructor theory, Pillur seeks to eliminate probabilistic methodologies from software development, offering a deterministic and counterfactual approach that simplifies complex tasks in robotics.

## Why Pillur?

The current landscape of robotic software development is heavily influenced by probabilistic models and methodologies. These approaches, while effective in certain contexts, often fall short in providing the precision and reliability required in robotics. Pillur challenges this paradigm by introducing a counterfactual approach, where tasks are defined by what is possible and impossible, rather than by probabilities. This shift not only enhances the accuracy of robotic software but also opens up new possibilities for innovation in the field.

## Key Concepts

- **Constructor Theory**: The foundation of Pillur, constructor theory shifts the focus from traditional laws of motion to principles that define what tasks are possible or impossible. In the context of robotics, this means creating software that can perform tasks reliably and deterministically.
  
- **Counterfactuals in Robotics**: Pillur’s approach to robotic software development is rooted in counterfactual reasoning—defining tasks based on the outcomes that can or cannot occur. This allows for more precise and reliable software, reducing the complexity and unpredictability of traditional approaches.
  
- **Deterministic Software Development**: By eliminating probabilistic elements from the development process, Pillur ensures that robotic software behaves predictably and consistently, even in complex environments.

## Project Goals

1. **Redefine Robotic Software Development**: Apply constructor theory to create a new framework for developing robotic software, focusing on deterministic and counterfactual principles.
  
2. **Create a Task-Oriented Language**: Develop a programming language within Pillur that allows developers to express and manage tasks in terms of what is possible and impossible, enhancing the reliability and precision of robotic applications.
  
3. **Develop and Test Robotic Applications**: Use Pillur’s framework to build and test robotic applications that demonstrate the practical benefits of a constructor theory-based approach.
