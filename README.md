# Pillur: Platform Engineering for Distributed AI and Robotics Applications

Welcome to **Pillur**, an open-source project dedicated to advancing the adoption and curation of ROS and Kubernetes (K8s) technologies. Our goal is to simplify the deployment and management of AI and robotics applications by leveraging state-of-the-art tools and practices in platform engineering.

## Overview

**Pillur** is designed to address the complexities of managing and scaling AI and robotics systems, especially in environments that require the orchestration of large fleets of robots. Our platform provides comprehensive support for CI/CD pipelines, environment management, and service orchestration, ensuring that your AI and robotics applications can scale efficiently and effectively.

## Key Features

- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: We employ a service-oriented approach to help with various aspects of platform engineering, from CI/CD pipelines to environment management.
- **Technologies We Use**: 
  - **Kubernetes (K8s)**: For container orchestration and management.
  - **Docker**: For containerization of applications.
  - **Tekton**: For powerful, Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipelines.
  - **Helm**: For managing Kubernetes applications.
  - **Crossplane**: For managing cloud resources and infrastructure as code.
- **Support for ROS**: Advanced integration with ROS2 (Robot Operating System), particularly the 'Jazzy' distribution, for robotic applications.

## Current Status

**Pillur** is in its inception phase, exploring customer needs and market patterns to provide a robust solution for scaling robotics fleets. We recognize the challenges faced by robotics companies in building and managing large numbers of robots, and our vision is to make this process as accessible and efficient as possible.

## Vision

We believe in the potential of platform engineering to transform the robotics industry by:
- **Scaling Robotics Fleets**: Enabling the management of over 1000+ robots with ease.
- **Efficient CI/CD Management**: Simplifying continuous integration and delivery for robotics applications.
- **Advanced Tooling and Practices**: Helping teams adopt the right tools and practices to enhance their productivity and software delivery capabilities.
