Claims that the standard procedure for testing scientific theories is
inapplicable to Everettian quantum theory, and hence that the theory is
untestable, are due to misconceptions about **probability** and about the
**logic of experimental testing**.

(My guess is that these misconceptions also hinder the curation and growth of developing **AI** Programs)

Refuting those claims by correcting those
misconceptions leads to an improved theory of scientific methodology
(based on Popper’s) and testing, which allows various simplifications,
notably the elimination of everything probabilistic from the
methodology (‘Bayesian’ credences) and from fundamental physics
(stochastic processes).

**Explanations of explicanda**

Prevailing discussions (e.g. Greaves & Myrvold 2010, Dawid & Thébault 2014) of the
testability of various versions of quantum theory have approached the matter
indirectly, in terms of support or confirmation – asking how our credence (degree of
belief) for a theory should be changed by experiencing results of experiments.

However, experimental confirmation is a philosophically contentious concept.
Notably, it is rejected root and branch by Popper (1959). I shall present an account of
the nature and methodology of scientific testing that closely follows Popper’s. 

It differs from his, if at all, by regarding fundamental science as exclusively
explanatory. 

That is to say, I take a scientific theory to be a conjectured explanation
(explanatory theory) of some aspects of the physical world – the explicanda of the
theory – that is testable (I shall elaborate what that means below) by observation and
experiment.

A scientific explanation is a statement of what is there in reality, and how
it behaves and how that accounts for the explicanda. Neither confirmation nor
credence nor ‘inductive reasoning’ (from observations to theories or to justifications
of theories as true or probable) appear in this account.

So in this view the problem described in Section 1 is about testing theories.
