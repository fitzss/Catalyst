 I think we do not have the slightest clue how to make an AGI. 
 
 I think what's standing between us and making an AGI is an explanatory theory. It'll be largely a philosophical theory rather than a computer science theory or mathematics or physics or anything like that. It'll be a new way of looking at what creativity is, what explanation is. 
 
And I think that qua computation, qua computer program, I would expect it to be very simple. Relatively simple. So it's not going to be reached by more and more billions and trillions of bits of data, that's not the kind of thing it is. We differ from monkeys, who have brains very similar to ours, or apes, the great apes, we differ from the great apes only by a few K of code.

In that few K of code is the bootstrap program for bootstrapping this qualitatively different type of program that we run. Infinitely different. You asked how optimistic I am. On the one hand, I think that with hindsight, we'll realize that there wasn't much to it.
Like, all we have to do is write this program of a few K and we're done.
But on the other hand, I see no sign of the philosophy that would allow us to do that.
And it's rather like the question of what is life, what that was like in, say, 1800. People wanted, some people, wanted life to be explicable as an ordinary physical process without any supernatural, without any magic, without any God, just laws of physics.

 Explanations. 
 It's because you can't formalize the notion of an explanation. You can always invent new modes of explanation, and they are conjectures, like any theory. So you might conjecture that so-and-so is a good mode of explanation. A
 nd the openness of science is connected with the non-formalizability of explanation. And by the way, that's exactly the same as the non-formalizability of mathematics.
