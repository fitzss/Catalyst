This project is about applyling constructor theory to programming, 
and providing an improved theory of software development (based on Popper’s) and testing (based on Deutsch's).

This allows for various simplifications, 
notably the elimination of everything probabilistic from the methodology (‘Bayesian’ credences) and from fundamental physics (stochastic processes).

The goal with this right now is to formulate and try to put together a walking skeleton, where a developers can express and manage their tasks in a Can and Cant language.

**Problem-Situation:**

Refuting misconceptions about probability and testing, and curating a daring speculation that a new programming language could be formulated solely in terms of principles about counterfactuals, and that the AI and Robotic Programs would follow from them as derivative, and perhaps approximate, properties.  

**Quotes:**

One comparatively simple and comprehensible theory can cover an infinity of indigestible facts. - Deutsch FOB

The Science of Can and Can’t sets out in nontechnical terms a new,
counterfactual mode of explanation based on scientific and philosophical
ideas that the author, Chiara Marletto, and I have pioneered. They provide
new tools and new principles to address a number of notorious problems in
physics and beyond. - Marletto


Since the Enlightenment, technological progress has depended specifically on the creation of explanatory knowledge.


Physical systems are objects that exist in the real world, which we attempt to describe via
theory. In the mathematical sciences, we invoke mathematical objects (e.g. scalars, vectors, 
tensors) to represent the state of a physical system. - Kuyper

Thus emergence is another beginning of infinity: all knowledge-creation
depends on, and physically consists of, emergent phenomena.
Emergence is also responsible for the fact that discoveries can be made in successive steps, thus providing scope for the scientific method. The partial success of each theory in a sequence of improving
theories is tantamount to the existence of a ‘layer’ of phenomena that
each theory explains successfully – though, as it then turns out, partly mistakenly.
Successive scientific explanations are occasionally dissimilar in the
way they explain their predictions, even in the domain where the
predictions themselves are similar or identical. - Deutsch BOI

A counterfactual mode of programming distributed systems that consists of Robotics and AI tasks.

Problem with current AI programming is that:
Assertions about probalitlies do not refer to the physical world they do not assert anything about the physical world. -Deutsch

Current AI programs are about probability and do not refer to the physcial world and hence when creating applications that do like Robotics,so this entails a problems as they lack the full decription. ^^
