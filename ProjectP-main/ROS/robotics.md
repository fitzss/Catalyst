Robots are programmable general purpose machines that directly
interact with the real world to perform tasks. - Bihlmaier

 a number of complete robot systems working together.
Although each robot system is in itself complete and can perform specific tasks,
additional benefits can be gained from coordinating them. Such a coordinated set of
robot systems is called a robot fleet.
[7] The coordination instance is hence called a fleet
manager or orchestrator. Consider a (large) number of mobile robots performing
logistics tasks in a warehouse environment. Each robot can independently transport
goods from location A to location B. The fleet manager has a global view of transport
tasks and vehicle positions. In order to avoid traffic jams and to minimize the overall
distance travelled, the fleet manager gives (high-level) orders to the individual mobile
robots instead of each mobile robot deciding only based on its local information. We will
look deeper into this topic in chapter 11. -Bihlmaier
