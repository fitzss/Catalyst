The idea that one person might understand everything that is understood
may still seem fantastic, but it is distinctly less fantastic than the idea that
one person could memorize every known fact. 

For example, no one could
possibly memorize all known observational data on even so narrow a
subject as the motions of the planets, but many astronomers understand
those motions to the full extent that they are understood. 

This is possible because {1} understanding does not depend on knowing a lot of facts as
such, but on having the right concepts, explanations and theories. 

One comparatively simple and comprehensible theory can cover an infinity of
indigestible facts. 

Our best theory of planetary motions is Einstein's general
theory of relativity, which early in the twentieth century superseded
Newton's theories of gravity and motion. 

It correctly predicts, in principle,
not only all planetary motions but also all other effects of gravity to the
limits of accuracy of our best measurements. 

For a theory to predict
something 'in principle' means that the predictions follow logically from the
theory, even if in practice the amount of computation that would be needed
to generate some of the predictions is too large to be technologically
feasible, or even too large for it to be physically possible for us to carry it
out in the universe as we find it.

Being able to predict things or to describe them, however accurately, is not
at all the same thing as understanding them. 

Predictions and descriptions in
physics are often expressed as mathematical formulae. 

Suppose that I
memorize the formula from which I could, if I had the time and the
inclination, calculate any planetary position that has been recorded in the
astronomical archives. 

What exactly have I gained, compared with
memorizing those archives directly? The formula is easier to remember -
but then, looking a number up in the archives may be even easier than
calculating it from the formula. 

The real advantage of the formula is that it
can be used in an infinity of cases beyond the archived data, for instance to
predict the results of future observations. 

It may also yield the historical
positions of the planets more accurately, because the archived data contain
observational errors. 

Yet even though the formula summarizes infinitely
more facts than the archives do, knowing it does not amount to
understanding planetary motions. 

Facts cannot be understood just by being
summarized in a formula, any more than by being listed on paper or
committed to memory. 

They can be understood only by being explained.

Fortunately, our best theories embody deep explanations as well as accurate
predictions. 

For example, the general theory of relativity explains gravity in
terms of a new, four-dimensional geometry of {2} curved space and time.

It explains precisely how this geometry affects and is affected by matter.

That explanation is the entire content of the theory; predictions about
planetary motions are merely some of the consequences that we can deduce
from the explanation.
