So constructor theory is all down to knowledge ultimately, and same with epistemology, and same with everything.  -DD

Constructor theory is a meta-theory with its own physical principles that are intended to supplement and constrain dynamical theories, such as quantum theory and general relativity, which therefore we call subsidiary theories, [8]. Every subsidiary theory that is constructor-theory compliant must provide a set of allowed states of the allowed substrates, endowed with a topology. - Marletto

**Constructor Theory** forms **Principles** about **counterfactuals** that are stated by saying what **tasks** are **possible**, what are **impossible**, and **why**.

In constructor theory all laws of physics are stated by saying what tasks are possible, what are impossible, and why. They are principles, which underlie and supplement the existing most fundamental theories of physics.

A **task** is a
**specified physical transformation** on a **substrate**,
which involves changing an **attribute** from one **state** to another.

A **constructor** for a **task T**
is a **system** which whenever presented 
with the substrate of the **substrate** of the **task T**
in one of the **input attributes**,
it delivers it in one of the **states** 
of the allowed **output attributes**,
and **retains the ability to do that again**.

A **task**
is **impossible**
if the laws of physics impose a limit on how accurately 
it can be performed by a **constructor**.
Otherwise,
  the **task** is possible.

**Constructor-theoretic** statements
never refer to specific **constructors**,
only to the fact that 
**tasks** are **possible** or **impossible**.

This is what allows them to be **scale** **and** **dynamics** **independent**.

Physical systems are objects that exist in the real world, 
which we attempt to describe via theory.
In the mathematical sciences, 
we invoke mathematical objects (e.g. scalars, vectors, tensors)
to represent the state of a physical system.
To underscore this relation between
physical objects that exist in the real world
and the
abstract objects used in their theoretical representation,
I shallow follow in referring to those
mathematical entities that represent the state of a system as the system's descriptors.  - Kuyper
