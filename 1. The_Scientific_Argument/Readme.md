# Physics aims at solving problems; as a consequence, it seeks, if possible, universal and exact testable laws,formulated in whatever mode of explanation happens to be appropriate.


## From the question of performing any computation. but now performing any transformation of physical objects, and not if given enough memory but, if given only knowledge because if there’s something you have to give it other then knowledge which itself couldn’t provide then its not universal.

The traditional conception of
physics and science,
takes for granted that scientific theories
can only be about what must happen
in the universe (or is likely to),
given what has happened.

But none of that is true.
It is no more than an arbitrary
limitation on our ability to understand the world.

Incorporating counterfactuals on an equal footing
with factual statements into
fundamental physics
