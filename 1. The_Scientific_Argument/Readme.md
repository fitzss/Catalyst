* # Physics aims at solving problems; as a consequence, it seeks, if possible, universal and exact testable laws,formulated in whatever mode of explanation happens to be appropriate.


## From the question of performing any computation. but now performing any transformation of physical objects, and not if given enough memory but, if given only knowledge because if there’s something you have to give it other then knowledge which itself couldn’t provide then its not universal.

### The traditional conception of physics and science, takes for granted that scientific theories can only be about what must happen in the universe (or is likely to), given what has happened. But none of that is true. It is no more than an arbitrary limitation on our ability to understand the world.  Incorporating counterfactuals on an equal footing with factual statements into fundamental physics.

# Fundamental Counterfactuals and Their Relation to the Physical World

This document provides an overview of fundamental counterfactuals and their connection to the physical world. The table below outlines key phenomena, the corresponding counterfactuals, physical laws, and notable related entities.

## Table of Counterfactuals and Physical World Relations

| Phenomenon           | Counterfactuals                                       | Physical Laws                                           | Notable Related Entities                                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Information**       | Possibility of 'flip' and 'copy'                     | Interoperability of information media                    | Universal computer, Universal constructor                  |
| **Quantum Information**| Impossibility of copying certain information states  | Interoperability of quantum information media            | Universal quantum computer, Universal constructor          |
| **Knowledge**         | Ability to enable transformations and remain embodied | To be discovered!                                        | Abstract catalysts, Universal constructor                  |
| **Work**              | Possibility of the seesawing transformation          | Conservation of energy, Counterfactual second law of thermodynamics | Scale-independent engines, Universal constructor  |

This table is central to understanding how counterfactuals (alternative possibilities) manifest in physical systems and how these systems are bound by fundamental physical laws.

## Explanatory theories with such counter-factual implications are more fundamental than predictions of what will happen.

  - A task A is possible (which I write as A✓ ) if the laws of nature impose no
    limit, short of perfection, on how accurately A could be performed, nor on how well
    things that are capable of approximately performing it could retain their ability to do
    so. Otherwise A is impossible (which I write as A✗ ).

  - It may be that construction tasks are the primitive entities in terms of which the laws
    of nature are expressed. In that case, a ‘set of ordered pairs of states’ would be only a
    provisional way of conceiving of tasks: ultimately substrates, states and
    transformations would be understood in terms of tasks, not vice versa.

  - A construction task specifies only intrinsic attributes of its substrates, not extrinsic
    ones such as the name or location of a particular instance.

# Counterfactual properties of physical systems
  ## The fundamental types of counterfactuals that occur in Physics are of two kinds:
        - one is the Impossibility of performing a transformation
        - the other is the Possibility of performing a transformation
