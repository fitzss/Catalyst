# Applying the C4 Model to Catalyst

## Introduction

Catalyst is a key project within Pillur that aims to revolutionize robotic software development through the application of Constructor Theory. To ensure that Catalyst is both understandable and scalable, we apply the C4 Model, a software architecture model that breaks down the system into four levels of abstraction: Context, Containers, Components, and Code. This structured approach allows us to clearly visualize and communicate the architecture of Catalyst, making it easier for developers, stakeholders, and collaborators to grasp the project’s intricacies.

## Level 1: Context

At the context level, Catalyst is viewed in the larger ecosystem of robotic software development. This level provides a bird’s-eye view of how Catalyst interacts with external systems, users, and other key actors.

- **Catalyst System**: The central system that orchestrates the task-oriented platform for robotic software development based on Constructor Theory.
- **Users**: Robotic software developers and system integrators who utilize Catalyst to build and deploy advanced robotic applications.
- **External Systems**: Catalyst interfaces with various external systems, including:
  - Cloud platforms for deploying robotic applications.
  - ROS (Robot Operating System) for handling robot-specific functionalities.
  - Databases for task storage and system state management.

This context diagram illustrates how Catalyst integrates into the broader robotics development ecosystem, highlighting its role as a platform for orchestrating and managing robotic tasks across diverse environments.

## Level 2: Containers

The containers level zooms in on the Catalyst system, detailing the major containers or components that make up the system, their interactions, and the technologies involved.

- **Task Management API**: Manages the definition, execution, and monitoring of tasks within Catalyst. This API allows developers to interact with the system programmatically.
- **Task Orchestrator**: Responsible for orchestrating tasks across various robotic systems, ensuring reliable execution even in distributed environments.
- **ROS Integration Layer**: Interfaces Catalyst with ROS, leveraging existing ROS functionalities while applying Constructor Theory principles.
- **Database**: Stores task definitions, system states, and related data. A distributed database could be used to support scalability.
- **User Interface (UI)**: A web-based interface that allows developers to interact with Catalyst, monitor tasks, and visualize system performance.

This containers diagram emphasizes the structure of Catalyst and the key technologies that enable its functionalities.

## Level 3: Components

At the components level, we further break down each container into its essential components, illustrating the internal structure and how these components collaborate to fulfill their roles.

- **Task Management API Components**:
  - **Task Definition Service**: Manages the creation and editing of task definitions.
  - **Task Execution Engine**: Executes tasks based on definitions, ensuring accurate and consistent task completion.
  - **Task Monitoring Service**: Tracks task progress and status, providing real-time feedback.

- **Task Orchestrator Components**:
  - **Scheduler**: Schedules tasks across different systems based on resource availability and system states.
  - **Execution Controller**: Manages the sequence of task execution, handling dependencies between tasks.
  - **Error Handler**: Ensures robustness by managing exceptions and errors during task execution.

- **ROS Integration Layer Components**:
  - **ROS Node Manager**: Manages the ROS nodes that Catalyst interacts with, ensuring smooth communication and task execution.
  - **ROS Task Adapter**: Translates Catalyst task definitions into ROS-specific commands for seamless integration.

- **Database Components**:
  - **Task Store**: Stores task definitions and related metadata.
  - **State Store**: Maintains current states of tasks, robots, and other system components.
  - **Log Store**: Logs and events related to task execution and system performance.

- **UI Components**:
  - **Dashboard**: Provides an overview of system status, including active tasks and system health.
  - **Task Editor**: A visual interface for creating and editing tasks.
  - **System Monitor**: Displays real-time data on system performance and task execution.

This components diagram helps in understanding the internal workings of Catalyst and how its components are structured to achieve the project’s goals.

## Level 4: Code

The code level dives into the implementation details of Catalyst, focusing on specific classes, methods, and functions within each component.

- **Task Execution Logic**: The core logic that handles task execution, ensuring tasks are performed as defined.
- **Integration Points**: Specific code interfaces with ROS, cloud services, and other external systems.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed implementation of error management within the system.
- **Data Models**: Defines how tasks, states, and other entities are represented within the system.

While this level is often not visualized in diagrams, it is crucial for developers working directly on Catalyst’s codebase, particularly in regulated environments or complex legacy projects.

## Supplementary Diagrams

To complement the core C4 diagrams, Catalyst may benefit from additional diagrams such as:

- **Deployment Diagram**: Illustrates how Catalyst is deployed across different environments, showing the distribution of containers and components in various nodes, cloud services, and robotic systems.
- **Dynamic Diagram**: Describes specific processes or workflows within Catalyst, such as task execution flow, error handling, or task orchestration across multiple robots.

## Conclusion

The C4 Model is an invaluable tool for structuring and visualizing the architecture of Catalyst. By applying this model, we ensure that Catalyst is not only well-organized and scalable but also easily understandable by all stakeholders. This clarity and structure will be essential as we continue to develop and expand the capabilities of Catalyst, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in robotic software development through the innovative application of Constructor Theory.
