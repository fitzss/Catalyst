# Catalyst: A Task-Oriented Robotic Software Language

Welcome to the official documentation for **Catalyst**, a revolutionary task-oriented robotic software language and platform. Catalyst is designed to empower robotic developers by abstracting the complexities of underlying infrastructure, allowing them to focus on defining, managing, and executing tasks efficiently.

## Overview

**Catalyst** is built on the principles of Constructor Theory, where tasks are treated as transformations governed by physical laws. This structured approach enables developers to harness advanced perception models and ensure real-time task execution in dynamic environments.

### Key Features

- **Task Abstraction**: Simplifies the creation and management of robotic tasks using Catalystâ€™s intuitive domain-specific language (DSL).
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Integrates sensory data from various modalities (e.g., vision, language, 3D spatial information) using advanced foundation models.
- **Real-Time Execution**: Ensures tasks are executed with real-time feedback, adapting to environmental changes.
- **Scalability**: Scalable across different robotic platforms, from simple mobile robots to complex industrial systems.
- **Flexibility**: Modular architecture that supports easy integration with various hardware and software ecosystems.

## Core Components

### Task Management Interface (TMI)
The TMI is the primary user interface where developers define and manage tasks. It includes:
- **Task Editor**: A user-friendly interface for creating and editing task definitions.
- **Syntax Checker**: Validates task definitions to ensure they meet Catalyst's rules and constraints.
- **Task Repository**: Stores all task definitions for easy retrieval and reuse.

### Multi-Modal Integration Layer (MIL)
Processes and aligns sensory data from various modalities into a unified representation for the robot. Key features include:
- **Vision Processor**: Processes and interprets visual data.
- **Language Processor**: Handles natural language processing tasks.
- **3D Scene Analyzer**: Analyzes spatial information and integrates it with other sensory inputs.

### Execution Engine (EE)
The heart of Catalyst, responsible for interpreting and executing tasks:
- **Task Interpreter**: Translates high-level tasks into specific commands.
- **Real-Time Controller**: Manages task execution with real-time feedback.

### Data Storage & Retrieval (DSR)
Manages the storage, retrieval, and management of task definitions, execution logs, and model data.

### API Gateway (API)
Facilitates communication between Catalyst and external systems, including cloud services and third-party models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To start using Catalyst, you'll need:
- A development environment with [insert required software/hardware here].
- Basic knowledge of [insert relevant languages/technologies here].

### Installation

1. Clone the Catalyst repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/catalyst.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd catalyst
    [Insert installation command here, e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt]
    ```
3. Run the initial setup:
    ```bash
    [Insert setup command here]
    ```

### Usage

1. Define your first task using the Task Management Interface (TMI).
2. Integrate your robot's sensory inputs with the Multi-Modal Integration Layer (MIL).
3. Execute the task with the Execution Engine (EE), and monitor real-time feedback.

### Example

```dsl
task "Pick up object" {
    step "Locate object using vision"
    step "Move to object location"
    step "Grasp object"
    step "Lift object"
}
