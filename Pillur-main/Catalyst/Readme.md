# Catalyst: Redefining Robotic Software with Precision

## Why Catalyst?

Catalyst is a task-oriented robotic software language designed to harness the possibilities and constraints—what *can* and *cannot* be achieved—within robotic systems. It leverages Constructor Theory, where tasks are fundamental transformations governed by the laws of physics.

### Counterfactual API

Catalyst introduces the **Counterfactual API**, which captures what tasks are possible (*CAN*) and what are impossible (*CAN'T*). This framework ensures that every task aligns with the physical constraints and possibilities of the environment, allowing developers to build reliable and efficient robotic systems.

### Vision

By focusing on counterfactual explanations—understanding what physical events could or could not happen—Catalyst provides a solid foundation for creating robotic systems that operate within their true physical limits. It's a precise and practical tool for the next generation of robotic software development.

# Catalyst: A Task-Oriented Robotic Software Language

## Vision

**Catalyst** is a task-oriented robotic software language designed to harness the power of possibilities and constraints (CAN and CAN'T) in robotic systems. Drawing from Constructor Theory, Catalyst enables developers and non-developers alike to define, manage, and execute tasks as structured transformations governed by the fundamental laws of physics. Each task in Catalyst is treated as a modular API, making the language flexible, scalable, and accessible to a wide range of users.

Catalyst empowers stakeholders across the spectrum—whether they are robotics engineers, product managers, or software developers—to contribute to the development of complex robotic systems. By providing a Counterfactual API that consists of CAN and CAN'T declarations, Catalyst offers a powerful and intuitive way to compose robotic behaviors, allowing teams to create sophisticated, data-driven, and modular robotic applications.

## Why Catalyst?

### **Task-Oriented Design**

At the core of Catalyst is the idea that tasks—defined as physical transformations—are the fundamental units of robotic systems. These tasks are abstracted into modular components (APIs) that can be easily combined and managed, providing a clear and structured approach to robotic software development.

### **Counterfactual API**

Catalyst introduces the concept of a Counterfactual API, where tasks are governed by CAN (possible) and CAN'T (impossible) declarations. This API forms the basis of how tasks are defined, managed, and executed within Catalyst, ensuring that all transformations align with the underlying physical laws.

### **Modular and Composable**

Catalyst allows for the creation of modular tasks that can be composed into more complex robotic behaviors. These tasks are treated as APIs that can be reused, extended, and combined in countless ways, providing flexibility and scalability.

### **Accessible to All**

Catalyst is not just for developers. It is designed to be accessible to product managers, robotics engineers, and other non-technical stakeholders, enabling them to define and manage tasks through visual interfaces or low-code tools. This democratizes the development process, allowing for greater collaboration and innovation.

### **Seamless Integration**

Catalyst is built with a cloud-native architecture in mind, ensuring that it can scale and integrate seamlessly with other cloud-based robotic systems. This makes Catalyst a powerful tool for building complex, data-driven robotic applications that can evolve over time.

## Abstract Example Workflow

Let's walk through an abstract example of how a task-oriented workflow might look in Catalyst.

### **Scenario**: Automated Object Sorting Robot

1. **Define Tasks**:
   - **Task 1**: Detect Object
     - CAN: Detects an object using a camera sensor.
     - CAN'T: Detect objects beyond a certain size or weight.
   - **Task 2**: Classify Object
     - CAN: Classifies the object based on predefined categories.
     - CAN'T: Classify objects with insufficient data.
   - **Task 3**: Sort Object
     - CAN: Sorts the object into the correct bin.
     - CAN'T: Sort objects that exceed the weight limit of the bin.

2. **Compose Tasks**:
   - Combine the tasks into a sequence:
     - **Workflow**: Detect Object -> Classify Object -> Sort Object.

3. **Manage and Execute**:
   - Deploy the workflow as an API within the Catalyst environment.
   - Monitor the workflow execution and optimize task parameters as needed.

4. **Iterate and Evolve**:
   - Based on feedback or new requirements, modify the existing tasks or introduce new ones.
   - Example: Introduce a new task for object scanning to gather additional data before classification.

5. **Automate**:
   - Set up automation tools within Catalyst to monitor the task execution and adjust the workflow dynamically based on real-time data.

By defining tasks in this structured, modular way, Catalyst allows for the creation of flexible and scalable robotic systems that can adapt to changing conditions and requirements. The Counterfactual API ensures that all tasks are governed by the fundamental laws of physics, providing a solid foundation for reliable and consistent robotic behavior.
